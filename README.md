- Abstract
- Load and machine characteristics
- Evaluation of the parameters
- Theory of the induction machine
- PID tuning and simulation
- Estimators configuration and operating regions determination
- Full simulation of speed, current and flux control

The full Matlab code and Simulink schemes are uploaded as well.
